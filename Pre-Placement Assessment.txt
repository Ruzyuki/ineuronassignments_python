Q17. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. Use list comprehension to solve this problem.

ANS:- [n for n in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] if n%2==0]



Q18. Implement a decorator function called ‘timer’ that measures the execution time of a function. The ‘timer’ decorator should print the time taken by the decorated function to execute. Use the ‘time’ module in Python to calculate the execution time.

ANS:- 

import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Record the starting time
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # Execute the decorated function
        end_time = time.time()  # Record the ending time

        execution_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"The function {func.__name__} took {execution_time:.6f} seconds to execute.")
        
        return result

    return wrapper
@timer
def my_function():
    # Code to be executed
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating a delay of 2 seconds

my_function()







Q19. Write a function called ‘calculate_mean’ that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean (average) of the numbers. The function should calculate the mean using the sum of the numbers divided by the total count.

ANS:-
